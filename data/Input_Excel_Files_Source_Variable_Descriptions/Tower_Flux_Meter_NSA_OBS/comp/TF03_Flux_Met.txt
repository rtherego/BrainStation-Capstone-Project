1. Data Set Overview

1.1 Data Set Identification

BOREAS TF-03 NSA-OBS Tower Flux, Meteorological, and Soil Temperature Data

1.2 Data Set Introduction

Continuous eddy-correlation flux measurements of sensible heat, latent heat, CO2, 
and momentum fluxes were made at the BOReal Ecosystem-Atmosphere Study (BOREAS) 
Northern Study Area (NSA) Old Black Spruce (OBS) site from March 1994 to October 
1996.

1.3 Objective/Purpose

The principal objective was to determine directly the net ecosystem exchange of 
CO2 and the surface energy budget over diurnal, seasonal, and annual time scales 
and to couple these observations with a comprehensive characterization of the 
physical environment (Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR), soil 
temperature, etc.).  In addition, CO2 and water vapor concentration throughout 
the forest column were measured.  This suite of long-term measurements should 
provide information to assess the effect of seasons and seasonal changes on the 
carbon balance of the forest.  Determination of the boundary layer CO2 
concentration anomaly can also be determined, and thus the effect of the forest 
on the boundary layer CO2 concentration can be studied.  

1.4 Summary of Parameters

Latent heat flux, sensible heat flux, carbon dioxide flux, momentum flux, CO2 
profile, water vapor profile, air temperature profile, net radiation, incident 
Photosynthetic Photon Flux Density (PPFD), reflected PPFD, below-canopy PPFD, 
wind speed and direction, soil temperature, precipitation amount.

1.5 Discussion

Eddy-correlation flux measurements for CO2 and H2O were made at the northern 
black spruce site from the late summer of 1993 through the fall of 1996. The 
principal objective was to directly determine the net ecosystem exchange of CO2, 
and the surface energy budget over diurnal, seasonal and annual time scales and 
to couple these observations with a comprehensive characterization of the 
physical environment (PAR, soil temperature, etc.). A low-power automated array 
was installed to measure eddy fluxes and forest column content of CO2, sensible 
heat, and water vapor; soil temperatures and moisture; and incident and 
intercepted PAR. The system was operated continuously from installation in 
September 1993 to October 1994 (with some gaps). Additionally, measurements of 
the flux of CO2 from the soil were made during the summer of 1994 using an array 
of automated open chambers. Among other things, these long-term measurements 
should allow assessment of the importance of winter respiration and assimilation 
during transitional periods to the annual carbon balance of the boreal forest.

3. Theory of Measurements

Most investigations of forest CO2 exchange have relied on models to extrapolate 
short-term gas-exchange measurements made with small chambers.  This approach has 
contributed greatly to understanding, but uncertainties are inevitable when 
small-scale observations are aggregated to whole ecosystems, and short-term data 
to annual balances.  An alternative approach, used here, was to use the eddy 
covariance technique over a complete growing season to directly measure the net 
exchange of CO2 between the atmosphere and a patch of forest several hectares in 
size.

4. Equipment

4.1 Sensor/Instrument Description

4.1.1 Collection Environment

The measurements were made at a remote (50 km from the nearest town and 5 km from 
the nearest road), old (70-90 years) black spruce site.  The coverage was 
relatively homogeneous, and the trees were approximately 10 m tall. The ground 
cover was primarily feather moss mixed with some lower-level areas of sphagnum 
bog.  The data were collected continuously through several years; therefore the 
full range of boreal weather conditions was experienced including temperature 
ranges between 30 and -40 degrees C.  

4.1.2 Source/Platform

The instruments were supported on a 31-m-tall Rohn 25-G triangular cross section 
communications tower.

4.1.3 Source/Platform Mission Objectives

The tower was erected to support instruments above the forest canopy to collect 
flux data at NSA-OBS.

4.1.4 Key Variables

Eddy-correlation measurements of latent heat flux, sensible heat flux, CO2 flux, 
and momentum flux.  Profiles of CO2, water vapor, and air temperature.  Incident, 
reflected, and below-canopy PPFD.  Wind speed and direction, soil temperature, 
precipitation.

4.1.5 Principles of Operation

Sonic Anemometer:
Three-dimensional orthogonal wind velocities (u, v, and w) and virtual 
temperature (Tv) were measured with a sonic anemometer (Applied Technology, 
Boulder, CO).  The path length between transducers was 0.15 m.  The sensor 
software corrected for transducer shadowing effects (see Kaimal et al., 1990).  
Virtual temperature heat flux was converted to sensible heat flux using 
algorithms described by Kaimal and Gaynor (1991) and Schotanus et al. (1983).

Infrared Absorption Spectrometer:
Water vapor and CO2 concentrations were measured with an open-path infrared 
absorption spectrometer.

4.1.6 Sensor/Instrument Measurement Geometry

The sonic anemometer was located at a height of 29-m on a 31-m triangular- cross-
section radio tower (Rohn 25-G).  The tubing inlet for the air sample was located 
0.5-m below the sonic anemometer. The LiCor sensors were placed in a climate-
controlled hut 20-m northeast of the tower.  The air was drawn down the tower at 
18 standard liters per minute.  The air was passed through a thermostated block 
to stabilize the temperature and drawn through the LiCor at 4 standard liters per 
minute.  Pressure was controlled in the cell of the LiCor at 53 kPa. 

Air temperature profiles were measured at 27.0 m, 8.2 m, and 1.15 m above ground 
level.  Relative humidity was measured at 27.0 m.  Wind speed and direction were 
measured at 29.6 m.  The sonic anemometer was mounted at 29 m. Under-canopy PPFD 
sensor arrays were placed at ground level.  Soil temperature probes were placed 
at depths of 1 cm, 5 cm, 10 cm, 20 cm, 50 cm, and 100 cm.  Soil heat flux plates 
were at depths of 1 cm, 5 cm, and 10 cm.

4.2 Calibration

4.2.1 Specifications

Sonic anemometer: Supplied by the manufacturer.  Instrument zeros and maintenance 
performed at least twice per year.

CO2 sensor: Calibrated every 3 hours by standard addition of 4% CO2 at 40 and 80 
standard milliliters per minute for 2 minutes 15-m below the sample inlet on 
tower.  Zero datum for the LiCor IRGA was achieved by passing sample air through 
a column of soda lime for 2 minutes.

H2O sensor: Calibrated every few months using a LiCor dew point generator.  
Calibration was checked by comparison with a Vaisala probe on the tower.  Zero 
information was recorded every 3 hours by passing sample air through a column of 
magnesium perchlorate for 2 minutes.

CO2 concentration calibration: Used an independent LiCor 6262 IGA and two span 
gases (~340 ppm and ~420 ppm).  These gas samples are traceable to the 1993 
Scripps-World Meteorological Organization (WMO) standard.  Calibrations were done 
every 3 hours by passing each of the gases through the LiCor IGA at 1.25 standard 
liters per minute for 2 minutes.  Zero information was achieved by the same 
method as that used for the the eddy CO2-sensor.

5. Data Acquisition Methods

Data for flux measurements were continuously recorded at 4 Hz while other 
parameters were recorded at 0.5 Hz.  The data were stored on a PC and collected 
twice per week.  The delay time between the wind speed and concentration 
measurement was calculated at 5.5 seconds.  The time constant for response time 
of the instrument to a change in the mixing ratio of the air sample was 
determined to be 0.6 seconds for CO2 and 1.25 seconds for H2O.  The difference in 
time was due to adsorption of H2O to the tubing.  The response-time corrections 
typically were 5 to 10% during the day and 15 to 25% at night.  An averaging time 
of 30 minutes was used and a linear least-squares regression was used to detrend 
the flux data.

precipitation or by malfunctioning transducers.

10.2 Quality Assessment

10.2.1 Data Validation by Source

None given.

11.2 Known Problems with the Data

CO2 fluxes may be underestimated when the friction velocity is less than 0.2 
m/sec.  The closed-path IRGA and long sampling tube resulted in an 
underestimation of water vapor and CO2 flux because of the damping of high-
frequency fluctuations.

None given.

12. Application of the Data Set

This suite of long-term measurements should provide information to assess the 
effect of seasons and seasonal changes on the carbon balance of the forest.  
Determination of the boundary layer CO2 concentration anomaly can also be 
determined, and thus the effect of the forest on the boundary layer CO2 
concentration can be studied.
