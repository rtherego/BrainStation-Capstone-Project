1. Data Set Overview

1.1 Data Set Identification

BOREAS TGB-01 Soil CH4 and CO2 profiles from NSA OJP, YJP, and OBS

1.2 Data Set Introduction

The Trace Gas Biogeochemistry (TGB)-01 team took soil gas profiles at the BOReal 
Ecosystem Atmosphere Study (BOREAS) Northern Study Area (NSA) Old Jack Pine 
(OJP), Young Jack Pine (YJP), Old Black Spruce (OBS), and Beaver Pond (BP) sites 
during the growing season of 1994.  Some of the soil samplers were placed in the 
ground during the summer of 1993 to ensure equilibration.  Portable samplers 
were used at sites where no permanent soil gas samplers were installed.  The 
soil gas samples were analyzed for CO2 and CH4.  At some of the OBS and BP 
sites, the soil/peat was saturated. At these sites, water samples were taken and 
analyzed for CH4 and CO2.

1.3 Objective/Purpose

Soil gas sampling profiles of CH4 and CO2 were completed to quantify controls on 
CO2 and CH4 fluxes in the boreal forest.

1.4 Summary of Parameters

The data contain measurements of the soil pore concentrations of CH4 and CO2.  
The data were measured at the soil surface and at different depths (5-93 cm 
below the surface) at the various locations.  Most of the profiles correspond 
with collar flux measurements.

1.5 Discussion

The soil gas profiles were taken at varying depths from 0 to 93 cm below the 
surface, where the surface (0 cm) is designated as the top of the vegetated 
ground cover.  At some sites, groups of samplers were permanently embedded in 
the ground to ensure consistency of sampling location.  The OBS site was divided 
into two different sets of data; one with aluminum chambers, and one with 
plastic chambers.  The OBS site where Patrick Crill (TGB-01) measured fluxes 
with aluminum chambers and collars had permanent samplers associated with each 
aluminum collar flux measurement.  The OBS site where Dean Moosavi (TGB-01) 
measured fluxes with plastic chambers and collars had soil gas profiles taken 
with a portable sipper associated with each of the plastic collar flux 
measurements.  Moosavi also measured the BP site fluxes, and the associated 
profiles were measured with a portable sipper.  The OJP site had a nest of 
permanent sippers associated with each aluminum flux collar.  The YJP site had 
only one nest of permanent sippers; therefore, it was to be associated with all 
aluminum collar flux measurements at that site.

3. Theory of Measurements

CH4 and CO2 measurements of soil pore gas and/or water can provide constraints 
and implications for flux controls at the surface (Crill, 1991). The profile 
measurements will enable the scientist to determine if the uptake/flux is 
occurring in a particular soil depth range.

4. Equipment

4.1 Sensor/Instrument Description

Shimadzu GC-14A, FID and TCD

CO2 was quantified with a Shimadzu GC-14A Gas Chromatograph (GC) with a thermal 
conductivity detector (TCD) operated at 70 degrees C after separation on a 
HayeSepQ column at 40 degrees C using ultrapure (99.999%) He as a carrier gas 
flowing at 30 mL/min.  CH4 was quantified with a Shimadzu GC-14A or a Shimadzu 
GC-MINI2 with a flame ionization detector (FID) operated at 125 degrees C after 
separation on a HayeSepQ column at 40 degrees C using ultrapure (99.999%) N2  as 
a carrier gas flowing at 30 mL/min.   Analog signals (0-1 V) from the detectors 
were digitized at 10 Hertz (Hz) with a Hewlett Packard (HP) 35000D A/D board and 
quantified and logged using HP ChemStation software.

4.1.1 Collection Environment

Samples were collected under ambient conditions.

4.1.2 Source/Platform

Soil and water.

4.1.3 Source/Platform Mission Objectives

The mission objective was to quantify the CO2 and CH4 soil profile 
concentrations present in the boreal forest NSA.  

4.1.4 Key Variables

CH4 and CO2 concentrations were the key variables measured at different depths 
in the soil or peat profile.

4.1.5 Principles of Operation

The Shimadzu GC-14A is equipped with a hydrogen FID and a TCD.  The FID is used 
to measure CH4, while the TCD is used to quantify CO2.  The FID uses a hydrogen 
flame in an air atmosphere to burn components as they exit the column.  In the 
flame, carbon-carbon bonds are fragmented so that various organic ions and free 
electrons exist.  Application of a voltage across a collector electrode over the 
flame causes an ion current to flow, which is amplified and then measured as the 
output signal. The TCD elutes CO2 by flowing a sample in a helium carrier gas 
past metallic filaments with current flowing through them.  The sample 
components with lower thermal conductivity than the helium carrier gas raise the 
filament temperature when they pass through.  The signal output from the TCD is 
a measurement of the change in filament resistance caused by the temperature 
rise.  The signal output from both the FID and TCD is for a data processor, 
integrator, recorder, or computer (Instruction Manual: GC-14A; Shimadzu 
Corporation, Kyoto, Japan). The GC-MINI2 was equipped with a FID and operated in 
the same manner as the GC-14A FID.

4.2 Calibration

Signal peaks from the detectors were quantified with working standards 
calibrated against Canadian AES (Canadian Atmospheric Environment Services) 
certified primary standards acquired by the BOREAS project and a CO2/ CH4 
standard of Niwot Ridge air prepared by National Oceans and Atmospheric 
Administration (NOAA) Climate Monitoring and Diagnostics Laboratory (CMDL). 

4.2.1 Specifications

None given.

4.2.1.1 Tolerance

The sensitivity of the TCD is approximately 6,000 mV mL/mg.  The FID's maximum 
sensitivity is 3*10-12 grams/second for diphenyl.

4.2.2 Frequency of Calibration

The instrument was calibrated on a daily basis.  Standards were run generally 
before and after samples on a given day of analysis.

4.2.3 Other Calibration Information

Signal peaks from the detectors were quantified with working standard calibrated 
against Canadian Atmospheric Environment Services (AES) certified primary 
standards acquired by the BOREAS project and a CO2/CH4 standard of Niwot Ridge 
air prepared by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) 
Climate Monitoring and Diagnostics Laboratory (CMDL).

5. Data Acquisition Methods

Soil profile samples were taken from different depths at the YJP, OJP lichen and 
moss, and OBS (Patrick Crill) sites with soil gas samplers (sippers) installed 
in August 1993.  The sippers are fabricated from 50 cm of high-efficiency 
stainless steel 1/8-inch tubing with small holes drilled along the last 10 cm.  
A hole was dug in the ground, and the stainless steel tubing was placed 
horizontally in the soil profile.  Polypropylene tubing attached the steel 
tubing to the surface, and allowed for sampling.  The polypropylene tubing was 
fitted with a polycarbonate/nylon stopcock at the surface.  Soil air was sampled 
using the polycarbonate/nylon stopcock and 60-mL polypropylene syringes.  A 
portable soil gas sipper was used at the OBS (Dean Moosavi), BP, and the OJP 
sites.  It was constructed with the same materials as the installed sippers. 
Prior to sampling, 10 mL of soil air was discarded to avoid contamination from 
ambient air.  After discarding the initial 10 mL of soil air, a 30-mL soil air 
sample was taken.  The syringes were fitted with rubber bands to prevent any 
leaking in of ambient air and were transported to the lab for analysis on the 
GC-14A FID/TCD and/or the MINI-2 FID.

In some cases when the soil/peat was saturated, the samples were taken as water 
samples. Prior to sampling, 10 mL of soil pore water was discarded to avoid 
contamination from ambient air.  After the initial 10 mL of soil pore water was 
discarded, a 30-mL soil pore water sample was taken.  In the lab, the syringes 
were filled to 60 mL with ultra high-purity nitrogen.  The syringes were shaken 
for 2 minutes to allow the dissolved CH4 and CO2 to enter the air space.  This 
method is described by McAuliffe, 1971.  The air in the syringe was then removed 
from the 60-mL syringe with a 10-mL glass syringe and run on the GC-14A FID/TCD 
and/or the MINI-2 FID.

For the data collected with the aluminum chamber fluxes (Patrick Crill):

The OJP collars and profile sampling sites were located as follows:
Moss collars were approximately northwest of the tower;  the profile corral was 
located a few meters south of the collars (55.9287o N, 98.6248o W).

The OJP lichen collars were due west of the tower; the profile trench was 
located about 1 m southeast of the collars (55.9280o N, 98.62481o W).

The YJP collars were located southeast of the tower; the gas profile corral was 
located approximately 1 m west of the collars (55.9286o N, 98.62019o W).

The OBS collars were located along a low to high moisture gradient from the 
lichen to the feather moss, the fen rim, and ending at the fen site.  The lichen 
and feather moss collars were located along the boardwalk approximately 200 m 
northeast of the tower. The fen rim and fen site collars were located due east 
of the lichen and feather moss sites about 150 m and 200 m, respectively.

For the soil profile data completed with the plastic chamber fluxes (Dean 
Moosavi):

The OBS collars and profile sampling sites were located as follows:  
The OBS sampling collars were located along a moisture gradient from feather 
moss and lichen sites to the fen rim site and ending with the fen sites.  The 
transect ran approximately east to west and was located about 200 m northeast of 
the tower at the OBS site (55.88007o N, 55.88007o W).

The BP collars and profile sampling sites were located as follows:  
The BP sampling sites were located along a low to high moisture gradient that 
began with the upland lichen site, then the sphagnum moss site, the mire site 
and ending at the pond site. The transect runs approximately north to south and 
is about 60 m from the BP tower (55.8422o N, 98.02747o W).

Global Positioning System (GPS) measurements were taken at the sampling sites 
but the data were not retrievable.

9. Data Manipulations

9.1 Formulae
Rf = Cstd / Astd
Cs = Rf * As

Rf = Response factor
Astd  = Average of 10 standard peak areas
Cstd  = Concentration of the standard
Cs = Concentration of the sample
As = Peak area of sample

CH4 and CO2 concentrations were calculated from the average of 10 peak areas of 
known CH4 and CO2 standards.  The response factor was calculated as the 
concentration of the known standard divided by the average of 10 standard peak 
areas.  The peak area of the unknown sample was multiplied by the response 
factor.

10. Errors

10.1 Sources of Error

Sampling error when pulling the syringe samples could include:

1.  Sampling too rapidly, causing the air/water sample to be taken from the 
vertical direction rather than from the depth at which the sampler was located.
2. Not flushing the line before sampling , which could cause dilution of the 
sample with air/water from the last sampling time.
3. Not completely closing the syringes or allowing them to come open during 
transport, causing dilution from ambient air.  (Errors such as this would have 
been written down in the lab/field books, and those data therefore would have 
been edited out.)

The analytical precision of the GC's is: 0.2% for CH4 and 1% for CO2.
