BOREAS TE-01 CO2 and CH4 Flux data over the SSA-OBS Site

Summary

The BOREAS TE-01 team collected various data to characterize the soil-plant 
systems in the BOREAS SSA.  Particular emphasis was placed on nutrient 
biochemistry, the stores and transfers of organic carbon and how the 
characteristics were related to measured methane fluxes.  The overall transect 
in the Prince Albert National Park (Saskatchewan, Canada) included the major 
plant communities and related soils that occurred in that section of the boreal 
forest.  Soil physical, chemical and biological measurements along the transect 
were used to characterize the static environment, which allowed them to be 
related to methane fluxes.  Chamber techniques were used to provide a measure of 
methane production/uptake.  Chamber measurements coupled with flask sampling 
were used to determine the seasonality of methane fluxes.  This particular data 
set contains carbon dioxide and methane flux values from the SSA-OBS site.  The 
data were collected from 09-JUN to 04-SEP-1994.

1.	Data Set Overview

1.1 Data Set Identification

BOREAS TE-01 CO2 and CH4 Flux data over the SSA-OBS Site

1.2 Data Set Introduction

Particular emphasis in this study was on nutrient biochemistry, the stores and 
transfers of organic carbon and how the characteristics were related to measured 
methane fluxes.  The transect in Prince Albert National Park included the major 
plant communities and related soils that occurred in that section of the boreal 
forest.  Soil physical, chemical and biological measurements along the transect 
was used to characterize the static environment, which allowed them to be 
related to methane fluxes.  Chamber techniques were used to provide a measure of 
methane production/uptake.  Chamber measurements coupled with flask sampling 
were used to determine the seasonality of methane fluxes.

1.3 Objective/Purpose

The objective of the research was to characterize the methane and carbon dioxide 
soil flux at the Southern Study Area (SSA) Old Black Spruce (OBS).

1.4 Summary of Parameters

The main parameters are daily and nightly CH4 and CO2 fluxes.

1.5 Discussion
