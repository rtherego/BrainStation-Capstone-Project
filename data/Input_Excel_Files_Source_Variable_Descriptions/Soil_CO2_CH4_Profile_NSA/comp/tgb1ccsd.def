7.3.2 Variable Description/Definition

         Column Name                             Description
------------------------------ ------------------------------------------------
SITE_NAME                      The identifier assigned to the site by BOREAS, in
                               the format SSS-TTT-CCCCC, where SSS identifies
                               the portion of the study area: NSA, SSA, REG, or
                               TRN; TTT identifies the cover type for the site,
                               (999 if unknown); and CCCCC is the identifier
                               for site (exactly what it means will vary with 
                               site type).
SUB_SITE                       The identifier assigned to the subsite by BOREAS,
                               in the format GGGGG-IIIII, where GGGGG is the
                               group associated with the subsite instrument
                               (e.g., HYD06 or STAFF), and IIIII is the 
                               identifier for the subsite (often this will refer
                               to an instrument).
DATE_OBS                       The date on which the data were collected.
CH4_CONC                       CH4 concentration.
CO2_CONC                       CO2 concentration.
SOIL_DEPTH                     The depth below the soil surface at which the 
                               measurement was taken.
COVER_TYPE                     The dominant species, vegetation or type of land
                               cover that exists at the location.
PROFILE_NUM                    Where the profile measurements were taken.
CRTFCN_CODE                    The BOREAS certification level of the data.  
                               Examples are Checked by PI (CPI), Certified by 
                               Group CGR), Preliminary (PRE), and CPI but 
                               questionable (CPI-???).
REVISION_DATE                  The most recent date that the information in the
                               referenced data base table record was revised.

Minimum Data Value -- The minimum value found in the column.
Maximum Data Value -- The maximum value found in the column.
Missng Data Value  -- The value that indicates missing data. This is used to
                      indicate that an attempt was made to determine the
                      parameter value, but the attempt was unsuccessful.
Unrel Data Value   -- The value that indicates unreliable data.  This is used
                      to indicate that an attempt was made to determine the
                      parameter value, but the analysis personnel deemed the
                      value to be unreliable.
Below Detect Limit -- The value that indicates parameter values below the
                      instrument's detection limits.  This is used to
                      indicate that an attempt was made to determine the
                      parameter value, but the analysis personnel determined
                      that the parameter value was below the detection
                      limit of the instrumentation.
Data Not Cllctd    -- This value indicates that no attempt was made to
                      determine the parameter value.  This usually
                      indicates that BOREAS Information System (BORIS) staff
                      combined several similar but not identical data sets into
                      the same data base table but this particular science team
                      did not measure that parameter.

Blank -- Indicates that blank spaces are used to denote that type of value.
N/A   -- Indicates that the value is not applicable to the respective column.
None  -- Indicates that no values of that sort were found in the column.
