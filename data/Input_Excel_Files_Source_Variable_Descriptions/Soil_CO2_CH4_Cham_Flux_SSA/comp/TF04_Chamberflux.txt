1.1 Data Set Identification

BOREAS TF-04 CO2 and CH4 Chamber Flux Data from the SSA

1.2 Data Set Introduction

Data presented in this document were collected at the Old Jack Pine and Young 
Jack Pine tower flux sites and nearby clear cut areas at the SSA. The BOREAS TF-
04 team measured fluxes of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) across the 
soil-air interface in four ages of jack pine forest at the Southern Study Area 
of the BOReal Ecosystem Atmosphere Study (BOREAS) during August 1993 to March 
1995.  Gross and net flux of CO2 and flux of CH4 between soil and air are 
presented for 24 chamber sites in mature jack pine forest, 20-year old and 4 
year old stands and a clear cut area. The data are stored in tabular ASCII 
files.

1.3 Objective/Purpose

This study presents data relevant to understanding the transfer and storage of 
carbon among soil, the unsaturated zone, ground cover vegetation, and understory 
air in jack pine forest at the SSA.  The data were collected continuously from 
May through September 1994 and during March 1995.

1.4 Summary of Parameters

The primary focus is on the net fluxes of CO2 and CH4 measured.

1.5 Discussion

Jack pine woodlands are an important component of the boreal forest, covering 
more that 2x1012 m2 of predominantly well-drained uplands in northern North 
America.  As part of BOREAS, our study objectives were (1) to compare soil 
respiration at an undisturbed 65- to 90-year-old mature jack pine-lichen 
woodland with soil respiration at a formerly continuous portion of the stand 
that was clear-cut harvested during the previous winter, and (2) to identify and 
quantify the sources of CO2 and CH4 production within the soil profile.

3. Theory of Measurements

Atmospheric chemistry measurements and modeling studies identify a global 
imbalance between known CO2 production and uptake, with a potentially large 
terrestrial carbon sink possible in boreal forests.  Northern woodlands are also 
perceived to be very sensitive to climate change.  The predicted warming and 
drying of the boreal region could profoundly affect regional carbon sources and 
sinks.  Carbon cycling of the boreal forest has consequently been a central 
theme of much recent field research.  With the intent of eventually 
extrapolating land-based carbon, energy, and water flux measurements to the 
entire boreal forest biome, the Boreal Ecosystem-Atmosphere Study (BOREAS) 
subdivided northern and southern section of Canadian boreal forest into aspen, 
jack pine, and bog-fen landscapes for intensive study.  Studies within these 
vegetation types focused on a variety of factors that influence carbon cycling, 
including forest stand age and land surface disturbances (Seller et al., 1995).

Soil respiration, the second largest flux in the global carbon cycle, includes 
all CO2 produced by roots, soil organisms, and oxidation that is emitted across 
the soil-air interface.  Although globally important, soil respiration is not 
well characterized spatially or seasonally for most ecosystems.

We derived response curves of measured soil CO2 emission versus soil temperature 
for the measurement transects and applied them to soil temperatures that were 
continuously recorded at the BOREAS OJP flux tower, located approximately 0.2 k, 
northwest of the OJP transect.  This allowed for simulation of continuous soil 
CO2 emissions for May Ò September 1994.  The simulation results, when considered 
with the winter tree removal, the deep well-sorted sandy soil, and the lack of 
complexity of the plant and soil communities, permitted separation of surface-
soil, deep-soil, and tree-root respiration at the OJP stand.  The OJP fluxes 
quantify the amount of CO2 that is transported across the forest floor and is 
available for photosynthetic uptake by ground cover and understory plants and 
tress or for emission to the atmosphere.  Because the groundcover was destroyed 
and all trees were removed by clear-cutting, the ÎCCÌ site fluxes represent net 
CO2 emission to the atmosphere during the period between forest harvest and re-
establishment of plant cover.

4.1 Sensor/Instrument Description

4.1.1 Collection Environment

Data were collected under all environmental conditions.

4.1.2 Source/Platform

Ground.

4.1.3 Source/Platform Mission Objectives

Support investigators and chambers.

4.1.4 Key Variables

CO2 and CH4 flux. 

4.1.5 Principles of Operation

Carbon dioxide and CH4 fluxes were measured by the static chamber techniques, 
which involves measuring the accumulation or loss of gas concentration within 
chambers placed on the soil surface versus time.  The chambers, which are 
cylindrical with an open bottom and a closed top, are constructed from 0.30 m 
inside diameter polyvinylchloride (PVC) irrigation pipe.  To prevent gas leakage 
to or from the chambers during measurement, that were affixed by a gasket to a 
collar, constructed from the same pipe material, that was inserted permanently 
into the soil to a depth of 0.10 m.  When deployed, the collars and chambers had 
a combined height of 0.28 to 0.30 m.  The chambers have a coiled 1.6-mm inside 
diameter aluminum tube installed through the sidewall near the top to equalize 
inside and outside pressure and are fitted with various gas ports for air 
circulation and sample collection.  Gross soil CO2 flux is the total amount of 
CO2 that passes across the soil-groundcover/air interface in the absence of 
photosynthesis.  Chambers for measurement of gross CO2 flux and ch4 flux have 
opaque PVC tops that create a dark chamber environment.  Net soil CO2 flux is 
gross flux minus CO2 uptake by groundcover photosynthesis.  Chambers for 
measurement of net CO2 flux have clear polycarbonate tops that are optically 
transparent across the window of photsynthetically active radiation, allowing 
plant photosynthesis to occur.  Air is recirculated inside the chambers at a 
rate of 0.25 chamber volume per minute to ensure mixing.

Gross and net CO2 flux were measured by continuously monitoring the CO2 
concentration in air circulating in a chamber placed on the soil surface.  CO2 
concentrations were recorded at 20-second intervals for 8 minutes using a LI-COR 
6200 IRGA.

Soil CH4 flux was measured by GC analysis of a time series of six syringe 
samples of air collected from the center of volume of the chamber.  Deployment 
times ranged from 24 to 40 minutes, depending on the anticipated flux rate.
Rate of gas emission of consumption were determined by the equation:
J=dC/dt x h 
where J is the rate of gas flux across the soil surface (mol/m2/s) C is the gas 
concentration in the chamber at ambient temperature and pressure (mol/m3), t is 
time, h is chamber height (m), and dC/dt is the slope of the best fit of the 
time series of concentration in the chamber as time approaches zero.

5. Data Acquisition Methods

Soil respiration was measured using closed chambers that attached to chamber 
collars permanently installed in the soil.  Three pairs of the 0.38 m diameter 
chamber collars were inserted 0.10 m into the soil at each site along a 60-m 
transect, having 30 m between pairs of collars and 1 m between collars within 
pairs. 

Traceable gas calibration standards for all CO2 and CH4 analyses were provided 
by BOREAS operations.  Carbon dioxide concentrations were measured using non-
dispersive infrared gas analyzers (IRGAS) calibrated to span the expected 
concentration range.  Three different IRGAs were used for measuring CO2 
concentration at the jack pine soil gas transects.  Accumulation of CO2 in soil 
gas flux chambers was measured using LI-COR model 6200.  In situ soil CO2 
concentrations exceed the range of the LI-COR 6200, so two PP System model EGM 
IRGAs were used, one having a range up to 5000 parts per million (ppm) CO2 and 
the second having a range up to 10,000 ppm CO2.

Methane concentrations were measured using a Chrompack model 438A gas 
chromatograph (GC) having a 2 meter 80-100 mesh Porapak-N column and a flame 
ionization detector.  Carrier gas was nitrogen and the oven temperature was 
maintained at 38C.  Methane concentrations were calculated from standards curves 
established from a series of CH4 Standards run between every 8 to 10 samples.  
Concentrations smaller than 0.49 ppm were calculated by linear extrapolation of 
integrator response between a 0.49 ppm CH4 standard and a nitrogen blank.

The measurements were made by sealing a 0.30-m tall opaque polyvinyl chloride 
chamber cover over a chamber collar and continuously circulating air from the 
chamber at top center, through a LI-COR 6200 CO2 analyzer, and back into the 
chamber through a perforated air-dispersion ring on the inside of the chamber 
base.  Chamber CO2 concentrations were measured at 1-s intervals and mean 
concentrations were recorded at 15-s intervals for 8 minutes.  Insertion of the 
chamber collars into the soil, circulation of chamber air through the gas 
analyzer, the relatively large chamber diameter, and the relatively short 
chamber deployment times were all intended to minimize chamber effects known to 
influence soil gas flux measurements.  CO2 emission rates were calculated using:

     J = dC/dt x h 

where J is the rate of CO2 flux across the soil surface (mol/(m2 s)) C is the 
CO2 concentration in the chamber at ambient temperature and pressure (mol/m3), t 
is time, h is chamber height (m), and dC/dt is the slope of the best fit of the 
time series of CO2 concentration in the chamber as time approaches zero.
