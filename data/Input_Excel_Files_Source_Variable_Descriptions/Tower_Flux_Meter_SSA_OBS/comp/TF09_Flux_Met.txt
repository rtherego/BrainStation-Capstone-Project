1. Data Set Overview

1.1 Data Set Identification

BOREAS TF-09 SSA-OBS Tower Flux, Meteorological, and Soil Temperature Data

1.2  Data Set Introduction

This data set includes heat, carbon dioxide, and water vapor fluxes measured by 
eddy covariance (EC) and meteorological data all measured from the Boreal 
Ecosystem-Atmosphere Study (BOREAS) Southern Study Area (SSA)-Old Black Spruce 
(OBS) tower. Soil heat flux and soil temperature profiles are also included.  
Through the winter of 1995 to 1996, soil temperature data were collected, these 
data are stored in separate files.

1.3  Objective/Purpose

The objectives of this study were to measure and model the CO2 exchanges of 
boreal black spruce forest to determine whether the soils and vegetation are 
significant global sinks for atmospheric CO2. Stand CO2 fluxes were measured 
using EC and the CO2 concentration profile was also measured to allow estimation 
of the atmospheric storage of CO2 within the canopy.
These measurements will be used to verify scaling up procedures from leaf level 
measurements and may be scaled up to regional scales. 

1.4  Summary of Parameters and Variables

Latent heat flux, sensible heat flux, carbon dioxide flux, soil heat flux, 
momentum flux, CO2 profile, water vapor profile, air temperature profile, net 
radiation, incident and reflected Photosynthetic Photon Flux Density (PPFD), 
incident and reflected solar radiation, wind speed and direction, friction 
velocity, soil temperatures, precipitation amount, vapor pressures.

1.5  Discussion

The tower at the SSA-OBS site (53.99° N, 105.312° W) was equipped with a CO2, 
water vapor, and sensible heat flux measuring EC system and a weather station to 
measure flux driving environmental variables.  CO2 concentration profiles and 
soil temperatures at various depths were also measured, as was soil heat flux.

The EC system at the top of the tower consisted of a Solent 3-D sonic anemometer 
and LI-COR LI-6262 closed-path infrared gas analyzer (IRGA).  The anemometer was 
placed 2.6 m above the top platform (25.8 m) on a vertical pole on the SW corner 
of the tower. The air was ducted by tube from close to the anemometer to the LI-
6262. The data were collected and processed in 'real time' to provide near- 
continuous measurements.
 
Profiles of CO2 and H2O vapor concentrations were continuously monitored.  In 
1994, five heights were measured; in 1996, measurements were made at eight 
heights through the canopy.  These measurements were made using an IRGA (LI-COR 
6262) fitted with time-switched solenoid valves.  The sample heights for 1994 
were at 1.5, 3, 6, 12, and 26 meters, corresponding to one-eighth, one-fourth, 
one-half, one, and two times the canopy height.  In 1996, the samples were 
collected at eight heights above the ground at approximately 0.5, 1.5, 3.5, 6.5, 
9.5, 12.5, 18, and 26 meters.  Air was drawn continuously through the sample 
pipes at each of the heights, and each line was sampled in turn.  In 1994 each 
line was sampled for 3 minutes of every 15 minutes; in 1996, each line was 
sampled for 1 minute every 10 minutes.  Data from the beginning of each period 
were discarded to allow for flushing of the short tube between the solenoids and 
the analyzer.  In 1994, the first minute of data was discarded; in 1996, the 
first 20 seconds were discarded.

At the top of the tower, a simple weather station was set up to measure the 
following environmental variables: net radiation, PPFD, shortwave solar 
radiation, temperature, relative humidity, vapor pressure, wind speed and 
direction, and rainfall.  In 1996, a second weather station, comprising a 
ventilated psychrometer and net radiometer, was set up at 2 m height above the 
ground.  Soil temperatures were measured at four locations at 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 
and 0.5 meters depth, using differential thermocouples referenced to thermistors 
at 1 meter.  Soil heat flux was measured using seven soil heat flux plates, 
buried about 7 cm below the surface.

3. Theory of Measurements 

The net carbon uptake of a forest depends on the assimilation of carbon dioxide 
by photosynthesis and on carbon dioxide emissions resulting from respiratory 
processes.  Carbon dioxide assimilation depends on the species, age, and 
physiological activity of the trees.  Emission depends on the respiratory cost 
of maintenance and growth, production of litter, and turnover of organic matter 
in the soil.  Influencing both these processes are soil, climate, and weather. 
During the day, carbon dioxide will generally be taken up by the stand by 
photosynthesis, while at night carbon dioxide is lost from the stand.  A 
conservation of mass equation gives: 

Fc = Fa + Fs + Fr + Fg + DS 

where Fc is the net flux of carbon dioxide into (or out of) the stand from the 
air above, Fa is the canopy assimilation (or at-night respiration), Fs is stem 
respiration, Fr is root respiration, Fg is soil respiration, and DS is storage 
of carbon dioxide in the air of the stand.  With EC, the carbon dioxide flux  is 
measured through a plane above the stand (Fc), and with the carbon dioxide 
concentration profile the change in storage (DS) can be estimated. 

The flux measurements were calculated using EC and corrections were applied to 
the covariances to correct for density effects (Webb et al., 1980).  Coordinate 
rotation of the wind vector components ensured that the flux calculated was 
perpendicular with respect to local streamlines, and transfer functions (Moore 
1986; Philip, 1963) were used to correct for inadequate frequency response. 

4. Equipment 

4.1 Sensor/Instrument Description.

4.1.1  Collection Environment

Measurements were collected from late May through mid-September 1994 and early 
April through late November of 1996.  Over that time period, temperature 
conditions from below freezing to over 30 °C were experienced.

4.1.2 Source/Platform 

Above-canopy measurements were made from a 23-meter double scaffold walk-up 
tower.

The anemometer used in the EC measurements was a Solent 3-D research ultrasonic 
anemometer.  The Solent outputs three orthogonal wind velocity components and 
the speed of sound from which air temperature may be derived at 21 Hz.  To 
measure CO2 and water vapor concentrations, a LI-COR LI-6262 closed-path IRGA 
was used.  Air 5 cm from the center of the sonic anemometer's path was ducted 
down a 32-m Dekabon tube (aluminum tube with PVC coating and polyethylene 
lining) of 6-mm internal diameter (i.d.).  The airflow down the tube was 
controlled by a Tylan FC2900B mass flow controller at 6 dm3 min-1, which 
resulted in pressure in the LI-6262's sample cell typically 7 kPa less than 
atmospheric.  The analog-to-digital (A/D) converter in the Solent was used to 
sample the analog output from the LI-6262 at 11 Hz.  The linear outputs of the 
LI-6262 were used, which allowed utilization of the LI-6262's processor to 
correct for sample cell pressure and for CO2 band broadening and dilution caused 
by water vapor.  The fully processed CO2 output of the LI-6262 is at 5 Hz and 
for H2O at 3 Hz. The combined wind velocity and IRGA outputs were then 
transmitted from the Solent serially and received by a notebook PC, where the 
fluxes were calculated by the EddySol software. 

All CO2 concentration data were logged on a Campbell Scientific CR10 logger, 
which also controlled the sample line switching three-way solenoid valves 
through a customized control circuit.  Sample pipes were of 5-mm-i.d. nylon 
tubing; CO2 adsorption/desorption was not considered a problem since all pipes 
were continuously purged to exhaust while not being sampled to the IRGA.  Sample 
points consisted of a gauze mosquito cover, an inverted funnel water trap and a 
fine particulate filter.  Sampling to the LI-COR 6252 IRGA was carried out via a 
Charles Austin dymax pump, downstream of which was a needle valve and flow 
meter, restricting flow to 0.5 dm3 min-1.  The downstream end of the IRGA was 
left open to the atmosphere, ensuring operation at atmospheric pressure.  The 
entire apparatus was housed off the ground, within an enclosed, but ventilated, 
metal box.

4.1.3 Source/Platform Mission Objectives

The objective was to measure CO2, water vapor, and sensible heat fluxes and 
related environmental variables over a black spruce stand at the southern edge 
of the boreal forest.

4.1.4 Key Variables

EC: CO2 and water vapor fluxes, sensible heat, latent heat fluxes, air 
temperature, and wind speed in nominal x, y, and z planes. 

Supporting meteorological variables: net radiation, PPFD, air temperature, wet 
bulb temperature, total solar radiation, wind direction, wind speed, soil 
temperatures, CO2, and water vapor concentration profiles. 

4.1.5 Principles of Operation 

The Solent anemometer uses pulses of ultrasound to measure windspeed.  The 
forward and reverse transit times for a pulse of ultrasound, between two 
transducers, gives the speed of sound and the wind speed (sound travels faster 
with a following wind).  The 3-D sonic has three pairs of transducers arranged 
in nonparallel axes, allowing the 3-D components of the wind velocity to be 
derived. 

The LI-COR LI-6262 IRGAs are closed path instruments with reference and sample 
cells with an infrared source at one end and a detector at the other.  Different 
gases absorb infrared of different frequencies and filters are used to select a 
narrow band that corresponds to an absorption band of the gas of interest.  The 
LI-6252 measures only CO2 while the LI-6262 measures CO2 and H2O concentration.  
A gas of known concentration is passed through a reference cell, and the gas 
whose concentration is to be measured is passed through the sample cell.  The 
amount of infrared reaching the detector in each cell is a function of the gas 
concentration in the cell.  The difference in voltage produced by the detectors 
of the reference and sample cells is then a function of the difference in 
concentration of the gas in the cells. 

Other sensors were common meteorological sensors used in a standard fashion.  
For principles of operations of these sensors, please see a relevant textbook, 
e.g., Pearcy et al. (1991).

4.1.6 Sensor/Instrument Measurement Geometry

The closed-path EC system was placed on an upright pole at the south west corner 
of the top of the flux tower.  The southwest corner was chosen because a tramway 
system was set up at the northern end of the tower, and the main fetch at the 
site is from the west.  Because the equipment was 3 m above the top of the tower 
on a pole, the tower would cause very little disturbance to the wind, whatever 
its direction.  Therefore, EC measurements would not be especially invalidated 
by any wind direction with respect to the tower; however, the access trail to 
the site is to the east, and any production of CO2 by people or vehicles on the 
trail may affect the CO2 fluxes measured if the wind is from the east.  Also, in 
the making of the access trail extensive damage was caused to the muskeg, with 
many trees being felled; hence, photosynthesis over this area will be 
uncharacteristically lower and respiration similarly high. 

Sample points for the CO2 concentration measurements for 1994 were at 1.5, 3, 6, 
12, and 26 meters, corresponding to one-eighth, one-fourth, one-half, one, and 
approximately two times the canopy height.  In 1996 the samples were collected 
at eight heights above the ground at 0.52, 1.66, 3.36, 6.44, 9.6, 12.66, 17.74, 
and 27.42 meters.

The weather station was set up on the eastern side at the top of the tower at 24 
m about 2.6 m horizontally from the EC system.  The rain gauge was located on 
top of the tower which was the place that offered the least obstruction.  Two 
net radiometers were mounted on the south side of the tower at a height of 16 m 
extending 3 m from the tower.  This position offered more symmetry of the effect 
of the tower on upward and downward fluxes than if the radiometers were placed 
at the top of the tower.  Two solarimeters (CM3, Kipp & Zonen) were also mounted 
on these booms, measuring incoming and reflected solar radiation.  The low-level 
EC system and weather station were set up approximately 30 m to the west of the 
main tower.  A net radiometer was positioned below the canopy, at a height of 2 
m above the ground.

In 1994, the soil temperature probe was located about 10 m from the southwest 
corner of the tower.  In 1996, four soil temperature probes were installed, two 
to the northeast and two to the southeast of the tower.  Two soil heat flux 
plates were placed within 5 m of each probe.

4.2 Calibration

4.2.1 Specifications

LI-6262, closed-path EC system: 
The output linearization of this instrument is calibrated by the manufacturer 
and was last performed in July 1993.  The field calibration fixes the lower and 
upper ends of the linearization function and is carried out by passing CO2 and 
water vapor free air through the reference cell (the instrument is used in the 
absolute mode) and setting the CO2 and water vapor channels to zero.  The upper 
point is set by passing dry air of known CO2 or of known water vapor 
concentration through the sample cell and adjusting the appropriate channel to 
read the correct value.  CO2 standard gases were cross-referenced to the BOREAS 
primary standards, and a LI-COR LI-610 dewpoint generator was used to produce 
air of known water vapor density. 

Solent anemometers: 
These instruments have stable calibrations, and factory values were used.  The 
calibrations have been tested in Edinburgh University's wind tunnel and were 
found satisfactory. 

LI-6262 CO2 concentration profile system: 
The IRGA was calibrated at the outset.  The air from the uppermost height was 
the same air that had been through the EC LI-6262 IRGA, and the analyzer was 
calibrated whenever the difference between the two IRGAs was more then a couple 
of ppm.  No corrections were applied to compensate water vapor cross-
sensitivity. 

Radiometers: 
One of the radiometers was purchased new from the manufacturers: the calibration 
factor supplied with it was assumed to be accurate, and it was used as a 
standard against which the second one was calibrated in July 1993. 

Quantum sensor: 
This was calibrated against another quantum sensor that is kept as a standard 
and is not used the field.  This calibration was performed in 1993. 

Cup anemometer: 
The cup anemometer was calibrated in the wind tunnel at Edinburgh University.

Humidity probe: 
The Skye temperature and humidity probe was calibrated in July 1993 by enclosing 
it in flasks containing salt solutions of known equilibrium water vapor 
pressures as supplied by Campbell. 

Psychrometer: 
1994: The psychrometer was calibrated in July 1993.
1996: The psychrometer were purchased new, and the manufacturer's calibration 
factors for the temperature sensors were assumed to be accurate. 

Wind vane:
This was purchased new, and the manufacturer's calibration factors were used. 

Pyranometer: 
This was purchased new, and the manufacturer's calibration factors were used.

4.2.1.1 Tolerance

None given. 

4.2.2 Frequency of calibrations 

The LI-6262 was usually calibrated, every 4 to 7 days. Typical CO2 drift was 1 
ppm drift in span and offset. Typical drift for the water vapor was 0.1 kPa in 
span and offset.

4.2.3 Other Calibration Information

None given.

5. Data Acquisition Methods

Closed-path EC system: Analog output from the LI-6262 IRGA (CO2 and water vapor 
concentrations) was digitized by the Solent anemometer at 11 Hz (which has 
provision for up to five analog inputs).  The three wind velocity components and 
speed of sound at 21 Hz were added, and 20 of these records were transmitted in 
a packet together almost every second to a computer (PC) using a serial (RS232) 
link.  The software (EddySol) then computed fluxes in real time, including 
coordinate rotation but not frequency response corrections.  Corrections for the 
effect of water vapor density on CO2 density were carried out by the LI-6262's 
internal software.  The Solent digitization is 11 bit with input voltage between 
0 and 5 V.  The LI-6262 output A/D converters were set for a 0 to 5 V range to 
correspond with a 300 to 500 ppm CO2 concentration range and a 0 to 25 kPa vapor 
pressure range.  Primary data and computed fluxes were stored on hard disk. 
Primary data were periodically offloaded onto removable Syquest hard disk 
cartridges. 

Three Campbell Scientific 21x data loggers were employed to log the data: one 
for the soil temperature probes and soil heat flux plates, one for the CO2 and 
H2O concentration profiles and one for the rest of the weather station.  The raw 
signal from each sensor was converted into the appropriate units in the data 
logger program.

7. Data Description

7.1 Spatial Characteristics

7.1.1 Spatial Coverage

All data were collected at the BOREAS SSA-OBS site.  North American Datum 1983 
(NAD83) coordinates for the site are latitude 53.98717° N, longitude 105.11779° 
W, and elevation of 628.94 m.

7.1.2 Spatial Coverage Map

Not applicable.

7.1.3 Spatial Resolution

The EC, CO2 concentration profile, and water vapor measurements are all point 
measurements but the concentrations of CO2 and water vapor and the temperature 
at a point are influenced by a certain area downwind, sometimes referred to as a 
'footprint'.  Other related terms are Wind Aligned Blob (WAB) and fetch, and 
their use is sometimes confused.

The footprint is the roughly pear-shaped (broad end toward the measurement 
point) area contributing to a particular measurement and its size and shape 
depends on measurement height, wind speed, sensible heat flux, and surface 
roughness during the measurement period.  The contribution to the measurement by 
a point upwind is a logarithmic function of distance .  The theoretical 
footprint is infinite, but to make the concept of a footprint more useful, the 
footprint should be defined as the area contributing to a certain proportion of 
the measured quantity; e.g., 95%. 

The term WAB as used in BOREAS is the area contributing to measurements over the 
period of the field campaign; i.e., the area occupied by the footprints of many 
measurements.  The shape of such a WAB is circular, though often with a sector 
discarded because either the wind rarely comes from that direction or 
contamination is expected from that direction. 

The fetch is the distance the wind travels over a certain surface type before it 
reaches a particular (e.g., the measurement) point.  Therefore, if one is trying 
to make measurements pertaining to a certain vegetation type, the length of the 
footprint should be less than or equal to the fetch over that vegetation. 

As the measurement is influenced by a large area downwind (the footprint) if the 
wind flow and vegetation over that area are homogenous, the measurements will be 
representative for that area; hence, the stringent requirements for EC sites. 

The CO2 concentrations are point data, vertically spread below the EC system 
with footprints similar to that of the top EC system but smaller and complicated 
by the less homogenous turbulence within the canopy compared to that above.

9. Data Manipulations

9.1 Formulae

Fluctuations were calculated using an autoregressive moving average (digital 
filter).  These fluctuations were used to calculate the covariances and 
variances.  Coordinate rotation was a geometric transformation.  The speed of 
sound was corrected for wind speed normal to the transducer path (Kaimal and 
Gaynor, 1990) with geometric transformations to allow for the nonorthogonal 
arrangement of transducer in the Solent anemometer.  Sonic temperature was 
calculated from the speed of sound, and corrections to sensible heat flux 
calculated using sonic rather than absolute temperature were made (Schotanus et 
al., 1983).  Corrections for nonideal response were applied (Moore, 1986; 
Philip, 1963).

9.1.1 Derivation Techniques and Algorithms

None.

9.2 Data Processing Sequence

Moving averages, variances, and covariances were calculated in real time, and 
coordinate rotation was applied on the half-hourly covariances and variances. 
Corrections for the use of sonic temperature were applied after data collection.

9.2.1 Processing Steps

BORIS staff processed these data by:

1) Reviewing the initial data files and loading them online for BOREAS team 
access.
2) Designing relational data base tables to inventory and store the data.
3) Loading the data into the relational data base tables.
4) Working with the team to document the data set.
5) Extracting the data into logical files.

9.2.2 Processing Changes

None.

9.3 Calculations

9.3.1 Special Corrections/Adjustments

None.

9.3.2 Calculated Variables

The eddy flux measurements on calm nights underestimate the surface fluxes.  
Inspection of the CO2 storage flux also shows that storage flux does not account 
for the underestimation by the CO2 eddy flux.  To provide estimates of the 
surface fluxes of CO2, H2O, sensible heat, and latent heat fluxes, the variables 
FILLED_CO2_FLUX_26M, FILLED_SENSIBLE_HEAT_26M, FILLED_LATENT_HEAT_26M, and 
FILLED_H2O_FLUX_26M have been added to the data set.  These variables are equal 
to the corresponding eddy flux values except on calm nights as defined below.  
Gaps in the eddy flux measurements have also been "filled in" by use of 
regression equations of eddy flux against meteorological variables.  Below is 
the SAS (SAS Institute, NC) program that was used to calculate these variables.

10. Errors

10.1 Sources of Error

The EC system was placed on an upright pole 3 m above the top of the tower so 
that the tower would cause very little disturbance to the wind, whatever its 
direction.  Therefore, EC measurements would not be especially invalidated by 
any wind direction with respect to the tower; however, the access trail to the 
site is to the east, and any production of CO2 by people or vehicles on the 
trail may affect the CO2 fluxes measured if the wind is from the east.  Also, in 
the making of the access trail, extensive damage was caused to the muskeg, with 
many trees being felled; hence, photosynthesis over this area will be 
uncharacteristically lower and respiration similarly high.

The eddy flux measurements on calm nights underestimate the surface fluxes.  
This problem is address in the filled data columns.

from the mean, long periods of constant values, and missing data.

11. Notes 

11.1 Limitations of the Data

See Section 10.1.

11.2 Known Problems with the Data

For the 1994 data:
Soil temperature at 1 m: before 1-July-1994 this was measured using a thermistor 
from which the signal was very noisy.  On 1-July-1994 at 22:30 Greenwich Mean 
Time (GMT) this thermistor was replaced by a thermocouple with a much more 
accurate output.  There was no trend in the soil temperature at 1 m before 15-
June-1994 at 02:00 with a mean of 0 °C and the noisy values for this period have 
been replaced with 0 °C.  From 1-June 02:00 GMT until 1-July-1994 20:00 GMT, the 
signal has been smoothed.  Any true diurnal trend has been removed by this 
substitution, but the values are estimated to be within 0.3 °C.

EC measurements: The data acquisition software missed the flux averaging times 
shown below. (This failure was caused by a fragmented hard disk making disk 
access slow.)  Data were not lost, although the fluxes were not averaged at the 
end of the half hour, but at the end of an hour.  Therefore, the missing 
averages (at the times shown below) have been substituted with the value 
calculated at the next half hour  (times given as GMT):
