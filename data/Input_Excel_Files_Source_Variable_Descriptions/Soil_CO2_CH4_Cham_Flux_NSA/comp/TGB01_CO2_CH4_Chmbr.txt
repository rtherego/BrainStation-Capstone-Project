1. Data Set Overview

1.1 Data Set Identification

BOREAS TGB-01 NSA CH4 and CO2 Chamber Flux Data

1.2 Data Set Introduction

Chamber flux measurements were taken at the Northern Study Area (NSA) Old Jack 
Pine (OJP), Young Jack Pine (YJP), Old Black Spruce (OBS), and Beaver Pond (BP) 
sites during the summer of 1994 by the BOReal Ecosystem-Atmosphere Study 
(BOREAS) Trace Gas Biogeochemistry (TGB)-01 team.  The values represent the 
average/mean flux from five values taken at 20-minute intervals.

1.3 Objective/Purpose

The purpose of these measurements was to examine the trace gas exchange between 
the atmosphere and the boreal soils.

1.4 Summary of Parameters

CH4 and CO2 chamber fluxes were measured at the NSA OJP, YJP, OBS, and BP sites.  
Temperatures of the chamber, 1-cm soil depth, and 10-cm soil depth were recorded 
at the OJP, YJP, and OBS (Patrick Crill) sites.  At the OBS (Dean Moosavi) and 
BP sites, temperatures at 5-, 10-, and 20-cm soil depths were recorded.

1.5 Discussion

The chamber flux data are provided in American Standard Code for Information 
Interchange (ASCII) comma delimited text files.  The data are a compilation of 
measurements from the aluminum chamber and collar sites at OJP, YJP and OBS 
(Patrick Crill) and the plastic chamber and collar sites at OBS (Dean Moosavi) 
and BP sites.  Another part of the data is a diurnal study completed 08-Jul-94 
and 09-Jul-1994 at the BP plastic collar and chamber sites.

3. Theory of Measurements

Chamber fluxes measure the changes in the mixing ratio of trace gases (CO2 and 
CH4) in a closed headspace over a period of time.  This headspace is isolated 
from the atmosphere; therefore, we can quantify the exchange of material between 
the covered soil and the headspace can be quantified.

4. Equipment

4.1 Sensor/Instrument Description

CH4 was quantified with a Shimadzu GC-14A Gas Chromatograph (GC) or a Shimadzu 
GC-MINI2 with a flame ionization detector (FID) operated at 125 degrees C after 
separation on a HayeSepQ column at 40 degrees C using ultrapure (99.999%) N2 as 
a carrier gas flowing at 30 mL/min.  CO2 was quantified with a Shimadzu GC-14A 
with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) operated at 70 degrees C after 
separation on a HayeSepQ column at 40 degrees C using ultrapure (99.999%) He as 
a carrier gas flowing at 30 mL/min.  The oven temperature during sample analysis 
was run at 130 degrees C and the detector at 300 degrees C. Analog signals (0-1 
V) from the detectors were digitized at 10 Hz with a Hewlett Packard (HP) 35000D 
A/D board and quantified and logged using HP ChemStation software.  Chamber 
fluxes were accomplished with aluminum chambers manufactured at the University 
of New Hampshire and designed by Patrick Crill.

4.1.1 Collection Environment

The chamber fluxes were collected under ambient conditions.  The GC analysis was 
completed at the Hayes Road Lab in Thompson, Manitoba.

4.1.2 Source/Platform

Ground.

4.1.3 Source/Platform Mission Objectives

This mission objective was to determine the soil-surface exchange rates of CH4 
and CO2 at the NSA OJP, YJP, OBS, and BP sites.

4.1.4 Key Variables

The key variables measured during the sampling period were CH4 and CO2 fluxes.  
The OBS site was divided into two different sets of data.  In the SITE_COLLAR, a 
C denotes the OBS site where Patrick Crill measured fluxes with aluminum 
chambers and collars.  An M denotes the OBS site where Dean Moosavi measured 
fluxes with plastic chambers and collars.  Plastic chambers and collars were 
also used at the BP site.  Soil profile temperatures were also recorded.

4.1.5 Principles of Operation

The Shimadzu GC-14A GC is equipped with a hydrogen FID and a TCD.  The FID is 
used to detect CH4, while the TCD is used to detect CO2.  The FID uses a 
hydrogen flame in an air atmosphere to burn components as they exit the column.  
In the flame, carbon-carbon bonds are fragmented so that various organic ions 
and free electrons exist.  Application of a voltage across a collector electrode 
over the flame causes an ion current to flow, which is amplified and then 
measured as the output signal.

The TCD detects CO2 by passing a sample, in a helium carrier gas, past metallic 
filaments with current flowing through them.  The sample components with lower 
thermal conductivity than the helium carrier gas raise the filament temperature 
when they pass through.  The signal output from the TCD is a measurement of the 
change in filament resistance caused by the temperature rise.  The signal output 
from both the FID and TCD is for a data processor, integrator, recorder, or 
computer (Instruction Manual: GC-14A; Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto, Japan).  The 
GC-MINI2 was equipped with a FID and operated in the same manner as the GC-14A 
FID.

4.2 Calibration

4.2.1 Specifications

None given.

4.2.1.1 Tolerance

The sensitivity of the TCD is approximately 6000 mV ml/mg.  The FID's maximum 
sensitivity is 3 x 10-12 g/s for diphenyl.

4.2.2 Frequency of Calibration

The instrument is calibrated on a daily basis.  Standards are run generally 
before and after samples on a given day of analysis.

4.2.3 Other Calibration Information

Signal peaks from the detectors were quantified with working standards 
calibrated against Canadian Atmospheric Environment Services (AES) certified 
primary standards acquired by the BOREAS project and a CO2/CH4 standard of Niwot 
Ridge air prepared by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) 
Climate Monitoring and Diagnostics Laboratory (CMDL).  Uncertainty in the 
standards’ analyses on a given day ranged from 0.1 to 0.2%.

5. Data Acquisition Methods

The chamber fluxes are determined by analysis of concentrations of methane (CH4) 
and carbon dioxide (CO2) in a time series of grab samples of headspace over the 
ground surface enclosed by a dark aluminum chamber.  The volumes of the two 
aluminum chambers were 0.071 and 0.120 m3 over an area of 0.397 m2.  The 
aluminum chamber was placed on the trough of an aluminum collar embedded in the 
ground.  Water was added to the trough of the collar to create an airtight seal.  
The volume of the plastic chambers was 0.028 m3 over an area of 0.078 m2. The 
seal between chamber and collar was made using weather stripping or water as 
appropriate.  Five 60-mL samples were removed from the headspace with 
polypropylene syringes and polycarbonate/nylon stopcocks at 4-minute intervals 
for 20 minutes (five samples). Samples were returned to the Hayes Road lab and 
analyzed for CO2 and CH4 using gas chromatography within 12 hours after 
collection.

7. Data Description

7.1 Spatial Characteristics

7.1.1 Spatial Coverage

The collars at the OJP tower site and profile sampling sites were located as 
follows:  collars located on moss plots were approximately northwest of the 
tower, while the profile corral was located a few meters south of the collars 
(55o55’43.2” N, 98o37’29.4” W).

The collars at the OJP site located on lichen plots were due west of the tower; 
the profile trench was located about 1 m southeast of the collars (55o55’40.9” 
N, 98o37’29.3” W).

The collars at the YJP tower site were located southeast of the tower;  the gas 
profile corral was located approximately 1 m west of the collars (55o53’42.8” 
N, 98o17’12.7” W).

The collars at the OBS tower site were located along a low to high moisture 
gradient from the lichen to the feathermoss, the fen rim and ending at the fen 
site.  The lichen and the feather moss collars were located along the boardwalk 
approximately 200 m northeast of the tower.  The fen rim and fen site collars 
were located due east of the lichen and feather moss sites about 150 m and 200 m 
respectively.

For data collected by Dean Moosavi:

The collars and profile sampling sites near the OBS tower were located as 
follows:  the OBS sampling collars were located along a moisture gradient from 
feathermoss and lichen sites to the fen rim site and ending with the fen sites.  
The transect ran approximately east to west and was located about 200 m 
northeast of the tower at the OBS site.  

The collars and profile sampling sites at the BP tower site were located as 
follows:  the BP sampling sites were located along a low to high moisture 
gradient that began with the upland lichen site, then the sphagnum moss site, 
the mire site, and ending at the pond site.  The transect ran approximately 
north to south and was about 60 m from the BP tower.

marks. There are no spaces between the fields.  Sample data records are shown in 
the companion data definition files (tgb1ccfd.def).

9. Data Manipulations

9.1 Formulae

Rf = Cstd/Astd
Cs = Rf * As

Rf = Response factor
Astd = Average of 10 standard peak areas
Cstd = Concentration of the standard
Cs = Concentration of the sample
As = Peak area of sample

CH4 and CO2 concentrations were calculated from the average of 10 peak areas of 
known CH4 and CO2 standards.  The response factor was calculated as the 
concentration of the known standard divided by the average of 10 standard peak 
areas.  The peak area of the unknown sample was multiplied by the response 
factor.  Fitting a regression curve to the time series of CH4 and CO2 
concentrations made the flux calculations.  The flux rate of a gas is calculated 
using the following equation:

F= ppmv/min*(P/R*MW)*1/T*Vc/Ac*C

Where:
F = flux (mg/m2/d)
P = Chamber pressure (atm)
R = 8.2054 x 10-5 m3 atm mol-1K-1
MW = Molecular weight of the analyte
T = Chamber temperature (K)
Vc = Chamber volume (m3)
Ac = Chamber area (m2)
C = (1000 mg/g*1440 min/d)

Gases:
CH4 = 16 g/mol
CO2 = 44 g/mol

At sites where oxidation of CH4 occurs, the flux starts at or near ambient CH4 
concentrations and is depleted below ambient concentrations. If the correlation 
coefficients were not significantly high, the flux was determined to be below 
the detection limit and was regarded as a zero flux rate.  If there was an 
efflux of CH4 was measured at any of these sites, those data were eliminated.

For sites where CH4 and CO2 were known to have a positive flux (from the soil 
into the atmosphere) the regressions of the time series were expected to have an 
r2 of greater than 0.85.

If -888 is present in the data set, it indicates that a measurement was taken 
but discarded for some reason.  If -999 is present, then no data were taken.

9.1.1 Derivation Techniques and Algorithms

Not applicable.

9.2 Data Processing Sequence

Not applicable.

9.2.1 Processing Steps

The peak areas were taken directly from the HP ChemStation reports from the GC.  
They were entered into spreadsheets and the concentrations were calculated by 
the formulas in Section 9.1.  The spreadsheets then automatically calculate the 
flux using the formulas.

9.4 Graphs and Plots

None.

10. Errors

10.1 Sources of Error

Field sampling error could account for some error in the concentration of the 
syringe samples:

1.  Not flushing the sampling line from the chamber before sampling could cause 
dilution of the sample with air from the last sampling time. 
2.  Not completely closing the syringes or allowing them to come open during 
transport will cause dilution from ambient air.
3.  Placing the chamber down with much force can change the pressure inside the 
chamber to other than ambient and can affect the mechanisms and processes 
producing/taking up CH4 and CO2.
(Errors such as these would have been written down in the lab/field books, and 
those data therefore would have been edited out.)

The analytical precision of the GC's is: 0.2% for CH4 and 1% for CO2.
