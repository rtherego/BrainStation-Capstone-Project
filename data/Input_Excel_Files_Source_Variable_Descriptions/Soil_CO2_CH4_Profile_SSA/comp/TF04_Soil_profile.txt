1.1 Data Set Identification

BOREAS TF-04 CO2 and CH4 Soil Profile Data from the SSA

1.2 Data Set Introduction

Data presented in this document were collected at the Old Jack Pine and Young 
Jack Pine tower flux sites and nearby clear cut areas at the SSA. The BOREAS TF-
04 team measured distributions of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) 
concentrations for the upper 5 meters of soil and unsaturated zone at the mature 
stand, upper 6 m at the 20-year old stand, and the upper 1m at the 8-year old 
stand and clear cut area at the Southern Study Area of the Boreal Ecosystem 
Atmosphere Study (BOREAS) during August 1993 to March 1995.  Particle size and 
carbon content of the unsaturated deposits, precipitation, soil temperature and 
moisture, carbon and oxygen isotopes of soil CO2 and soil water chemistry are 
also presented. The data are stored in tabular ASCII files.

1.3 Objective/Purpose

This study presents data relevant to understanding the transfer and storage of 
carbon among soil, the unsaturated zone, ground cover vegetation, and understory 
air in jack pine forest at the SSA.  The data were collected continuously from 
May through September 1994 and during March 1995.

1.4 Summary of Parameters

The primary focus is on the net concentrations of soil CO2 and CH4 measured.

1.5 Discussion

Jack pine woodlands are an important component of the boreal forest, covering 
more that 2x1012 m2 of predominantly well-drained uplands in northern North 
America.  As part of BOREAS, our study objectives were (1) to compare soil 
respiration at an undisturbed 65- to 90 year-old mature jack pine-lichen 
woodland with soil respiration at a formerly continuous portion of the stand 
that was clear-cut harvested during the previous winter, and (2) to identify and 
quantify the sources of CO2 and CH4 production within the soil profile.

3. Theory of Measurements

Atmospheric chemistry measurements and modeling studies identify a global 
imbalance between known CO2 production and uptake, with a potentially large 
terrestrial carbon sink possible in boreal forests.  Northern woodlands are also 
perceived to be very sensitive to climate change.  The predicted warming and 
drying of the boreal region could profoundly affect regional carbon sources and 
sinks.  Carbon cycling of the boreal forest has consequently been a central 
theme of much recent field research.  With the intent of eventually 
extrapolating land-based carbon, energy, and water flux measurements to the 
entire boreal forest biome, the Boreal Ecosystem-Atmosphere Study (BOREAS) 
subdivided northern and southern section of Canadian boreal forest into aspen, 
jack pine, and bog-fen landscapes for intensive study.  Studies within these 
vegetation types focused on a variety of factors that influence carbon cycling, 
including forest stand age and land surface disturbances (Seller et al., 1995).

Soil respiration, the second largest flux in the global carbon cycle, includes 
all CO2 produced by roots, soil organisms, and oxidation that is emitted across 
the soil-air interface.  Although globally important, soil respiration is not 
well characterized spatially or seasonally for most ecosystems.

4. Equipment 

4.1 Sensor/Instrument Description

4.1.1 Collection Environment

Data were collected under all environmental conditions.

4.1.2 Source/Platform

Ground.

4.1.3 Source/Platform Mission Objectives

Support investigators and soil probes.

4.1.4 Key Variables

CO2 and CH4 concentrations. 

4.1.5 Principles of Operation

Soil surface temperature was measured using a Fluke model 51 K thermometer at 3 
depths (0.05, 0.10, and 0.15 m) at each pair of chambers in conjunction with 
flux measurements.

Soil water content was determined from soil samples collected at each pair of 
chambers concurrent with flux measurements.  Each sample included the top 0.05 m 
of soil and was sealed in an air-tight container until analysis.  The samples 
were weighed, oven-dried at 105 C for approximately 24 hours, and weighed again.  
After subtracting the container weight, percent water content was calculated as 
the difference of the original sample weight and the dried sample weight divided 
by the original sample weight and multiplied by 100 (Klute, 1986)

Concentrations CO2 and CH4 in soil gas were measured at chamber pairs at each of 
the four transects using 2.0 mm inside diameter stainless steel probes.  The 
probes were inserted to soil depths ranging from 0.02m to 0.50 m, and soil gas 
was collected using nylon syringes.  CO2 concentration was analyzed on-site 
using a PP Systems model EGM IRGA, and CH4 concentration was analyzed by gas 
chromatography using methods described above.  Soil gas collection was 
concurrent with chamber measurements.

In addition to the chamber pair probe measurements, each site had a series of 
permanent probes installed for soil gas collection.  The Old Jack Pine site had 
permanent probes installed within 10 m of the first chamber pair (GH) to a 
maximum depth of 3.4 m.  The Young Jack Pine site had permanent probes installed 
within 10 m of the first chamber pair (AB) to a maximum depth of 6.0 m.  
Additional probes were located 5 m south of the Young Jack Pine instrument 
shelter.

Soil gas was collected from three series of depths in the unsaturated zone at 
Young Jack Pine.  Carbon dioxide, extracted from the gas by cryogenic trapping, 
was analyzed for 13C and 18O content using mass spectrometry at the U.S. 
Geological Survey gas isotope laboratory in Denver, Colorado.  Values were 
obtained from samples collected on one occasion.  Stable isotope values are 
presented in delta notation in units of the parts per thousand relative 
difference (permil) between the ratios of 13C to 12C and 18O to 16O in the samples 
and Pee Dee belemnite for 13C and Standard Mean Ocean Water for 18O.

Gravity drainage lysimeters were installed at the Young Jack Pine and Old Jack 
Pine sites to collect liquid water percolating through the unsaturated sands to 
a maximum depth of 1.00 m.  Only one rainfall event (day 200, 1994) was large 
enough to initiate sufficient percolation at the Young Jack Pine site for water 
sample collection and analysis.  Sufficient water volume was never collected at 
the Old Jack Pine site.
